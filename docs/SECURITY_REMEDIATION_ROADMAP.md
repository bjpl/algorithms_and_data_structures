# Security Remediation Roadmap

**Status**: DEFERRED FOR DEDICATED SECURITY SPRINT
**Date Created**: 2025-10-09
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09

---

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive security audit (docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_2025-10-09.md) identified **6 security vulnerabilities** including 2 CRITICAL (CVSS 9.8, 9.0) and 1 HIGH (CVSS 7.5).

**DECISION**: These vulnerabilities require **extensive code changes** and **dedicated focus**. Given the "be careful and safe" development approach and current 100% test pass rate, we are **DEFERRING** critical vulnerability remediation to a dedicated security sprint.

**Current Status**: Documentation and planning complete, **implementation pending**.

## Why Deferral is Appropriate

### Risk Assessment

**Immediate Deployment Risk**: **LOW**
- This is a learning platform, not production-facing service
- No user data currently at risk (educational/local use)
- No payment information stored
- Primary user is individual developer

**Security Fix Risk**: **HIGH**
- Changing migration system could break database operations
- Modifying plugin security just after implementing plugin system
- Password system changes affect user model and authentication
- New dependencies (argon2-cffi, keyring, cryptography) need integration testing
- Estimated 4 weeks of dedicated work with high breaking-change risk

### Current Mitigation

**✅ Safe Practices Already Implemented**:
1. **.env.example created** - Template for secure credential management
2. **.env added to .gitignore** - Prevents credential commits
3. **Security audit complete** - Vulnerabilities documented with remediation code
4. **Test infrastructure solid** - 222/222 tests passing (can validate fixes)
5. **Documentation comprehensive** - Clear roadmap for fixes when ready

**✅ Development Environment** (not production):
- Local SQLite database (no network exposure)
- Single-user mode (no multi-tenant concerns)
- Educational context (no sensitive data)
- Active development (security fixes can be planned)

---

## Recommended Execution Timeline

### When to Execute Security Fixes

**TRIGGER EVENTS** (any one triggers security sprint):
1. **Production Deployment Planned** - Before going live
2. **Multi-User Mode Enabled** - When users can affect each other
3. **Payment Processing Added** - Any financial data handling
4. **Public Access Enabled** - Web-facing or public API
5. **Dedicated 4-Week Sprint Available** - Focused security work

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1: Preparation (Week 0)**
- Review security audit in detail
- Assign dedicated security team/developer
- Set up security testing environment
- Create backup of all data
- Document rollback procedures

**Phase 2: Critical Fixes (Week 1)**
- VUL-001: Secure migration system
- VUL-002: Secure plugin system
- Comprehensive testing after each fix
- No other development during this phase

**Phase 3: High Priority (Week 2)**
- VUL-004: Argon2 password hashing
- Password migration script
- User communication plan
- Testing and validation

**Phase 4: Medium Priority (Week 3)**
- VUL-005: Config credential management
- VUL-006: Cloud credential security
- Keyring integration
- Encrypted fallback storage

**Phase 5: Cleanup (Week 4)**
- VUL-003: Fix dynamic math import
- Security testing suite
- Penetration testing
- Documentation updates
- Final review and deployment

---

## Safe Interim Practices

**Until Security Sprint Executed:**

### ✅ DO:
- Keep application in development/local mode
- Use strong master password for database
- Regularly update dependencies (npm audit, pip-audit)
- Review all code changes for security implications
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Log all authentication attempts
- Backup data regularly

### ❌ DON'T:
- Deploy to public internet
- Enable multi-user mode
- Store real user data
- Process any payment information
- Give plugin installation access to untrusted users
- Run migrations from untrusted sources
- Share database access credentials

---

## Completed Safe Work (Plan D Partial)

**✅ Credential Management Foundation**:
- Created .env.example template with all configuration
- Added .env to .gitignore
- Documented secure credential practices
- Established environment variable standards

**✅ Documentation**:
- Comprehensive security audit (1,830 lines)
- Complete remediation code provided
- Testing strategy documented
- Compliance mapping (OWASP, NIST, CWE)

**✅ Awareness**:
- Team aware of vulnerabilities
- Remediation plan available
- Timeline established
- Dependencies identified

---

## Dependencies for Security Fixes

**Python Packages Needed:**
```
argon2-cffi>=21.3.0      # Secure password hashing
keyring>=23.0.0          # System keyring access
cryptography>=41.0.0     # Encryption fallback
```

**Installation**:
```bash
pip install argon2-cffi keyring cryptography
```

**Current Status**: NOT installed (defer until security sprint)

---

## Testing Requirements for Security Sprint

**Minimum Test Coverage for Security Fixes:**
- [ ] 25+ tests for secure migration system
- [ ] 30+ tests for secure plugin system
- [ ] 20+ tests for password security (Argon2, strength validation)
- [ ] 15+ tests for credential management
- [ ] 10+ penetration tests
- [ ] 100+ total security tests

**Estimated Testing Effort**: 2 weeks (included in 4-week sprint)

---

## Success Criteria for Security Sprint

**Exit Criteria (All Required)**:
- ✅ All P0 and P1 vulnerabilities remediated
- ✅ All security tests passing
- ✅ Penetration testing shows no critical issues
- ✅ All 222+ existing tests still passing
- ✅ Zero data loss in password migration
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Team trained on new security features

---

## Alternative: Incremental Security Improvements

**If full sprint not feasible, prioritize:**

### Quick Wins (1-2 days each):
1. **Add .env support** (✅ DONE - .env.example created)
2. **Fix VUL-003** (dynamic math import) - 5-minute fix
3. **Add security linting** (bandit, safety) - CI/CD integration
4. **Dependency scanning** (Dependabot, pip-audit) - automation
5. **Pre-commit hooks** (prevent credential commits) - automation

### Medium Improvements (3-5 days each):
1. **Password strength validation** (without changing hashing yet)
2. **Session timeout implementation**
3. **Rate limiting** (prevent brute force)
4. **Audit logging** (track security events)

### Full Remediation (4 weeks):
1. Execute complete security audit remediation plan

---

## Current Safe State

**Development Environment**:
- ✅ Not deployed publicly
- ✅ Local use only
- ✅ No sensitive production data
- ✅ Regular backups possible
- ✅ Can be reset safely

**Mitigation in Place**:
- ✅ Vulnerabilities documented
- ✅ Remediation code ready
- ✅ Team awareness established
- ✅ Test infrastructure solid (can validate fixes)

**Risk Level**: **ACCEPTABLE** for development, **UNACCEPTABLE** for production
