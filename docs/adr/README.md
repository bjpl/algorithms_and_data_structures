# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural and technical decisions made in the Algorithms and Data Structures Learning Platform project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help maintain institutional knowledge and provide clarity on why certain approaches were chosen.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY

## Context
What is the issue we're addressing? What factors are at play?

## Decision
What is the change we're making? What approach are we taking?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or harder as a result of this decision?

### Positive Consequences
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative Consequences
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated and why were they not chosen?

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- Description
- Why not chosen

### Alternative 2: [Name]
- Description
- Why not chosen

## References
- Related documentation
- External resources
- Related ADRs
```

## How to Use ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Overall system architecture
- Technology stack choices
- Design patterns to adopt
- Major refactoring approaches
- Integration strategies
- Testing strategies
- Security approaches

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create ADRs for:
- Implementation details
- Minor code style choices
- Bug fixes
- Routine maintenance
- Obvious decisions with no alternatives

### ADR Workflow

1. **Propose**: Create draft ADR with status "Proposed"
2. **Discuss**: Review with team, gather feedback
3. **Decide**: Team agrees on decision
4. **Accept**: Update status to "Accepted", merge to main
5. **Implement**: Use ADR to guide implementation
6. **Update**: Deprecate or supersede if decision changes

## ADR Statuses

- **Proposed**: Under consideration, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and is being followed
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant, but kept for historical record
- **Superseded by ADR-XXX**: Replaced by a newer decision

## Contributing

When adding new ADRs:
1. Use next sequential number (ADR-008, ADR-009, etc.)
2. Follow the template structure
3. Update this README index
4. Link related ADRs
5. Get team review before accepting

**Note**: ADRs are living documents. Update them as context changes, but preserve historical decisions with proper status updates.
