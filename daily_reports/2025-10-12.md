## Work Completed

### 1. Technology Stack Documentation

**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**:
- `docs/ad_hoc_reports/technology_stack.md` (1,233 lines added)

**Changes Made**:
- Documented complete Node.js ecosystem (TypeScript, testing frameworks, build tools)
- Captured Python tooling and dependency management systems
- Detailed SPARC methodology phases and command structure
- Documented Claude Flow orchestration with all 54 agent types
- Captured dual-platform architecture and integration patterns
- Established comprehensive reference for development environment

**Impact**:
- Complete visibility into development technology choices
- Clear documentation of SPARC workflow and command usage
- Comprehensive agent catalog with capabilities and use cases
- Foundation for onboarding and technology decision-making

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Dual-Platform Architecture Documentation

**Context**: Project utilizes both Node.js and Python ecosystems with distinct purposes

**Options Considered**:
1. **Single Platform Focus** - Pros: Simpler documentation, reduced complexity Cons: Incomplete picture, missing critical tooling
2. **Comprehensive Dual-Platform** - Pros: Complete coverage, accurate representation Cons: More extensive documentation required

**Decision**: Full dual-platform documentation with clear separation of concerns

**Rationale**:
- Node.js handles build tooling, TypeScript compilation, and JavaScript execution
- Python manages SPARC orchestration, automation scripts, and AI coordination
- Both platforms essential to development workflow
- Documentation must reflect actual architecture for accuracy

**Trade-offs**: More extensive documentation effort but provides complete and accurate technology reference

---

### Decision 2: Agent Catalog Completeness

**Context**: Claude Flow provides 54 specialized agents across multiple categories

**Options Considered**:
1. **High-Level Overview** - Pros: Concise, easier to maintain Cons: Missing specific capabilities
2. **Complete Catalog** - Pros: Full reference, detailed capabilities Cons: Lengthy documentation

**Decision**: Document all 54 agents with categories and primary functions

**Rationale**: Complete agent catalog serves as essential reference for:
- Selecting appropriate agents for specific tasks
- Understanding coordination and specialization capabilities
- Planning swarm orchestration strategies
- Training and onboarding developers on available tooling

**Trade-offs**: Extensive documentation but critical for effective agent utilization
